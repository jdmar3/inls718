# Reading science

Reading science is different than reading other forms of literature. 
The purpose of science writing is to communicate the results of empirical studies such that they can be used to support new science and future studies. 
Science is incremental. 
It builds on past work, allowing what we know, collectively, to grow and change over time. 

The guides below will help you to read and evaluate science writing for the purposes of this class and other classes you will take.

## Differences in epistemology and approach

It's important to understand the limitations of our approaches to research. 
Often these limitations can be expressed through epistemology. 
It also helps to consider how our methods are related to our worldview. 
Our reading of research is also similarly affected. 
This guide helps to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative research. 
It also may help to understand the parallels between the two.

## Literature review

The purpose of literature review is to understand the state-of-the-art and history of a given topic. 
Literature review can be variously applied depending on the need. 

The following guides might help you in scoping and conducting your literature review.

Related to literature review, another important aspect of your assignments will be to write a memo for the system/service proposal. 
This set of guides and tutorials by Dr. Raul Pacheco-Vega may be helpful.

# Reference management

It is recommended that you become comfortable with using a reference manager in order to organize your readings and literature review. 

Here is a list of reference managers. 
Please explore them and choose one that you think will work best for your workflow and toolchain. 

  - <a target="_blank" href="http://paperpile.com">Paperpile</a> Subscription-based ($2.99/month for academic use); browser-based: designed for Chrome and Google apps. Integrates with Google Docs for easily incorporating citations and reference lists into documents. Stores PDFs in Google Drive. 
  - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> Freemium (storage upgrade: $20/year 2GB, $60/year 6GB); cloud-/browser-based: client compatible with Linux, Mac, Windows. Plugins for Firefox, Chrome, Safari.
  - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mendeley.com">Mendeley</a> Freemium (storage upgrade: $4.99/month 5GB, $9.99/month 10GB); cloud-based: desktop client compatible with Linux, Mac, Windows, Android.

## Database of readings

You can download the readings for this course in their current state as a BIB file. This file can be used to import the readings into your reference manager.

# Workflow and time management

Managing your workflow and time is difficult. 
No one knows this better than your instructor. 

There are a huge number of techniques that can help you in managing your work and get you through grad school without being overwhelemed. 
I find Dr. Pacheco-Vega's guides and suggestions to be very helpful.

# Writing style

The <a target="_blank" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2330-1643;jsessionid=15EB4081160D59A1716249BAFF1D4EAA.f04t03">Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (JASIS&T)</a>, the flagship journal for the field of information science, uses the style of the American Psychological Association (APA) as the basis for it's own style. 

Given that, we will use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Publication-Manual-American-Psychological-Association/dp/1433805618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473617254&sr=8-1&keywords=apa+manual+6th+edition">*Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th Edition*</a> (APA, 2009) in all of the writing for this class. 
It is important to understand this style in the immediate period, because some aspect of your grade will be related to the use of the style. 

You can find guides about its use online.

## Epistemology of science writing

But writing style is about more than just where to put periods and commas in your reference list. 
There are epistemological reasons that underlie the development and use of a given writing style. 
The article below will help to give you a sense of what that means for our purposes (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unm.edu/~wac/History-Legacy/Fall2005/LanguagePsychology.pdf">PDF available here</a>).
