We will be using the following three texts throughout the course. 

**Adams, J. L. (2001). {% marginfigure "cb" "assets/img/covers/cb.jpg" %} *Conceptual Blockbusting: A Guide to Better Ideas.* Cambridge, Massachusetts: Perseus Publishing.** 

This book is all about breaking down the barriers that block us creatively and conceptually so that we might think around and through a problem rather than simply running into it head on and getting nowhere. It will also help us in learning techniques for collaborative development and adapting to social workflows. Adams will surprise you by showing you new ways to think about things that you regularly overlook. 

**Norman, D. A. (2013). {% marginfigure "det" "assets/img/covers/det.jpg" %} *The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition.* New York: Basic Books.** 

This book is all about the psychology of design and how subtle changes can make a huge difference in the way that people interact with objects, tools, and technologies. Don Norman is a genius of design psychology. This book will help us to get into the mind of the user so that we can better consider needs and affordances that can change the nature of an interaction. You'll never look at a teapot the same way again. 

**Miller, L. (2015). {% marginfigure "ux" "assets/img/covers/ux.jpg" %} *The Practitionerâ€™s Guide To User Experience Design.* New York: Grand Central Publishing.** 

Luke Miller is a graduate from the SILS MSIS program. He takes a hands-on, practical approach to user experience. We will use this book as a reference and resource for designing workflows, creating prototypes, and evaluating our design output and process.

We will also be reading articles from UX and design journals and blog. These will be posted on the schedule page, usually a week ahead of time. A full BibTeX database will be linked here for download and continuously updated over the course of the semester.
