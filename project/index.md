We will be working with local entrepreneur and hardware engineer Erica Young on an interface project related to helping people better interact with GNURadio, primary interface for use with software defined radio (SDR) boards. The entire class will work on this project. The experience will be like that in a company. 

Students will self-organize, based on skills and interests, into teams that will be responsible for managing different aspects of the project. We will aim to create a working prototype by the end of the semester. In doing this we will learn about hard skills of interface design, such as: A/B and user testing, prototyping, and rollout. We will also be learning also soft-skills necessary for UX design, such as project management, workflow design/management, and collabration management. 

Over the course of the semester, we will learn how our individual skills and interests can be applied in the context of a mixed design/development team. A timeline of major project milestones over the course of the semester will be posted here.
