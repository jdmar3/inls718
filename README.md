INLS 718 - USER INTERFACE DESIGN - Spring 2017

This site houses the course site, syllabus and schedule for INLS 718. 

Description: 

This course is very different from others you have taken. We will focus our discussions on critical thinking about design and user experience, or "design thinking." We will engage in design critique on a continuous basis over the course of the semester.

Work for the course will be centered on a single project on which the whole class will work, operating like a design and development team, rather than working on individual projects. Collaboration is one of the major organizing principles for this course.

The course runs from 12 January 2017 - 27 April 2017.

Class is held on Tuesday and Thursday (except university holidays), 12:30-13:45 in 014 Manning Hall.

The course description, as it appears in the UNC course catalog:

> Basic principles for designing the human interface to information systems, emphasizing computer-assisted systems. Major topics: users' conceptual models of systems, human information processing capabilities, styles of interfaces, and evaluation methods.
