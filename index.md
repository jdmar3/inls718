{% newthought 'Welcome to INLS 718.' %} 

This course is very different from others you have taken. We will focus our discussions on critical thinking about design and user experience, or "design thinking." We will engage in design critique on a continuous basis over the course of the semester. 

Work for the course will be centered on a single project on which the whole class will work, operating like a design and development team, rather than working on individual projects. Collaboration is one of the major organizing principles for this course.

The course runs from {{ site.data.dates.begin.date | date: "%-d %B %Y" }} - {{ site.data.dates.end.date | date: "%-d %B %Y" }}. 

Class is held on {{ site.data.info.days.varlong }} (except university holidays), {{ site.data.info.time.var }} in {{ site.data.info.location.var }}. 

Tuesdays will typically be reserved for discussion and Thursdays will be design lab days in which you will work with your teams with me present.
