## Linux (Kali)

{% marginnote 'unix' '**Linux** is one such UNIX clone originally invented in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. It is now among the most widely used operating systems in the world. If you have used the Internet, you have interacted with Linux perhaps without even realizing it. We are using Kali Linux in this course because it is easy to install/run in either a virtual machine or on a live disk and has all of the software packages we need.' %}

## VIM (UNIX text editor)

{% marginnote 'vim' '**VIM** is a text-only, command-based text editor that is meant to be used when no graphical user environment is available. When making commits in git, if you forget to add a message in the command, this is the editor that pops up automatically. It is good to know this and other text editors just in case you are using a Linux system that only has a command line interface. ' %}
