Today we're going to do two things: 

1. Make sure that we are all up and running with VirtualBox, Kali, and GNURadio. 
2. Actually do a walk through with Erica and set up a receiver on our own devices. 

Today we become the user. We'll want to keep some questions in mind as we do.

# Interaction Questions

These are derived from {% cite Miller2015-qa --label page --locator 27 %}

1. When would you use this GNURadio?
2. Outline the tasks that you perform to work with GNURadio (get specific).
3. How do you do you know what device you are interfacing with?
4. Where would you start?
5. What would you do next?
6. Could you show someone else how you do that?
7. What information do you need to complete this task?
8. Is any part of this process difficult or frustrating?
9. Is the result or the process what you were hoping for?
10. Whatâ€™s the most enjoyable part of this process for you?

We will answer each one of these in turn as we go through today's activity.
