Welcome to INLS 718. 
This is a course about the design of user interfaces, interactions, and experiences. 

<excerpt/>

In class today we will go over the structure and presentation of material for the course and introduce ourselves to one another. 

We will go through the [syllabus](/syllabus/) and the [grade contract](/syllabus/inls718-sp2017-gradecontract.pdf) for the course.

# GitHub

Everyone will set up an account on GitHub. Those of you who already have one will help others do so. We will use this throughout the course.Everyone

# Semester project

Erica Young, our resident entrepreneur and guest, will explain the background for the project we will undertake this semester. She will be joining us throughout the semester to help orient the project and give feedback. 

# So, what is user interface design?

We will also introduce a few concepts, mostly through discussion.
