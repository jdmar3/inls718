Important comic about documentation: http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2017/02/20/no-ones-fault/

Today in class we are going to look at one of the worst modes of documentation and user education and speculate about ways to fix it:

*Terms of Service; Didn't Read,* https://tosdr.org/

In pairs, you will select a ToS and do some basic sleuthing about it. 

I want to know:

- Name of site/service
- Main URL of site
- URL of ToS
- How many clicks from homepage? 
- Mechanism for affirming reading and agreement
- Word count of ToS (https://wordcounter.net/website-word-count)
- Reading level of ToS (https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/read-able/)

We'll put all this in a spreadsheet online: https://goo.gl/7BIf7H
