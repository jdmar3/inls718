Today we will discuss tool choice and what it means when we use one tool over another. 
We'll also talk about how tools are not an accident of circumstance. 
They all have specific design constraints that came along with their development and the worldview of their authors embedded within. 

We will watch this [TED talk by Clay Shirky on open source government](https://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government).

I would recommend listening to this episode of the TED Radio Hour after class today to reflect on what it means to engage in open development.
