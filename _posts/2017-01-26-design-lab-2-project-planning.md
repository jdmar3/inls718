Please read over (deep skim) the following tutorials under the "Alternative Paths" section here: 
<a href="http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Guided_Tutorials#Basic-GNU-Radio-Usage-for-Signals" target="_blank">Basic GNU Radio Usage for Signals</a> 

<excerpt/>

Here are links to the individual tutorials:

1. [Introduction](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Guided_Tutorial_Introduction) or [Introduction to GNU Radio](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/WhatIsGR).
2. [Working with GNU Radio Companion (GRC)](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Guided_Tutorial_GRC).
7. [PSK Symbol Demodulation](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Guided_Tutorial_PSK_Demodulation).

These will serve as the basis for our prompts in the Charrette.

Today we will actually conduct our own design charettes in groups in class. 
This will help us to envision the future of our project and allow us to develop steps from the present day to that future.
