Today we will have a crash course in using Git, GitHub, and Slack for collaboration. 
Elliott Hauser will join us to help get us up and running on GitHub and share insights about collaboration from his experience working on <a href="https://trinket.io/" target="_blank">Trinket</a> and integrating GitHub into his teaching practice.
I recommend that you look over the above tutorials and cheat sheets before coming to class.

We may also talk about downloading and running [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) either in VirtualBox, from a live disk, or natively (if you are really adventurous) if we have time. 
It is more likely that we will get to this next week.
