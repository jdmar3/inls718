Be sure to look again at the parts of Tuesday's readings for examples of user personas. 

  - {% reference Miller2015-qa %}
    - Heading: "Getting to know your users," pp. 20-29. 
  - {% reference Lidwell2010-pg %}
    - "Personas," p. 182.

We will analyze our self-observations from last time to create some personas for novice users.
