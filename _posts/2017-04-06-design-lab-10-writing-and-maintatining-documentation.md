Today we're going to sketch up the features that we looked at last week and write a piece of documentation for them. 

In the documentation, I want to see you describe:

1. What the feature does (functionally) for a user.
2. Expected user inputs (what does the user do?) and program outputs (what can the user expect in response?).
3. Possible errors that may result (if any) and corrective suggestions for user. 

Put this all in comments on the issue that you created last week. 
Alternatively, you can do the work elsewhere and link to the files in the comments.
